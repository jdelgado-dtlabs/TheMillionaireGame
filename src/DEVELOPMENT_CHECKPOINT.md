## Session Summary

### Latest Session (Lifeline Icon System) - December 23, 2025 ✅ FEATURE COMPLETE

#### Lifeline Icon Visual Display System
- ✅ **LifelineIcons Helper Class** (MillionaireGame.Core/Graphics/LifelineIcons.cs)
  - LoadIcon() loads from embedded resources (MillionaireGame.lib.textures namespace)
  - GetLifelineIcon(LifelineType, LifelineIconState) returns appropriate icon with caching
  - GetIconBaseName() maps lifeline types to icon filenames: ll_5050, ll_ata, ll_paf, ll_switch, ll_ath, ll_double
  - GetStateSuffix() handles state suffixes: "" (Normal), "_glint" (Bling), "_used" (Used)
  - Icon caching via Dictionary<string, Image?> for performance
  - 18 embedded icon resources (6 types × 3 states each)

- ✅ **LifelineIconState Enum**
  - Hidden: Icon not shown (invisible during explain phase until pinged)
  - Normal: Lifeline available and visible (black/normal state)
  - Bling: During activation or demo ping (yellow/glint with 2s timer)
  - Used: Lifeline consumed (red X overlay)

- ✅ **Screen Integration** - All Three Screen Types
  - DrawLifelineIcons() method added to HostScreenForm, GuestScreenForm, TVScreenFormScalable
  - **Optimized positioning (1920×1080 reference)**:
    * HostScreenForm & GuestScreenForm: (680, 18) horizontal, spacing 138px, size 129×78
    * TVScreenFormScalable: (1770, 36) VERTICAL stack, spacing 82px, size 72×44
  - Per-screen tracking: _showLifelineIcons bool, _lifelineStates/Types dictionaries
  - Public methods: ShowLifelineIcons(), HideLifelineIcons(), SetLifelineIcon(), ClearLifelineIcons()
  - Drawing logic skips Hidden icons: `if (state == LifelineIconState.Hidden) continue;`

- ✅ **Dual Animation System** (LifelineManager)
  - **Demo Mode**: PingLifelineIcon(int, LifelineType)
    * Shows Bling state with sound effect (LifelinePing1-4)
    * Independent 2-second timers per lifeline via Dictionary<int, (LifelineType, Timer)>
    * Returns to Normal state after timer expires
    * Used during explain game phase for demonstration
  - **Execution Mode**: ActivateLifelineIcon(int, LifelineType)
    * Silent Bling state without timer
    * Used during actual lifeline execution
    * No sound effect played
  - All 6 lifeline types integrated: 50:50, PAF, ATA, STQ, DD, ATH

- ✅ **Progressive Reveal During Explain Phase**
  - Icons start in Hidden state when explain game activated
  - User clicks lifeline buttons to ping and reveal icons
  - InitializeLifelineIcons() checks _isExplainGameActive flag
  - Sets Hidden during explain, Normal during regular game

- ✅ **State Persistence** - Critical Bug Fixed
  - **Problem**: Icons reverted to Normal when loading new questions
  - **Root Cause**: GameService had two separate lifeline collections:
    * GameService._lifelines (List) - updated by UseLifeline()
    * GameState._lifelines (Dictionary) - checked by InitializeLifelineIcons()
  - **Solution**: UseLifeline() now updates BOTH collections
  - InitializeLifelineIcons() preserves Used states by querying GameState.GetLifeline(type).IsUsed
  - Used states persist across questions until game reset

- ✅ **Screen-Specific Visibility Logic**
  - Host/Guest: Icons remain visible during winnings display
  - TV Screen: Icons hidden when showing winnings (early return in RenderScreen)
  - ShowQuestion(true) → ShowLifelineIcons()
  - ShowQuestion(false) → keeps icons visible (user control)
  - ResetAllScreens() → ClearLifelineIcons()

- ✅ **IGameScreen Interface Updates**
  - ShowLifelineIcons(): Make icons visible
  - HideLifelineIcons(): Hide all icons
  - SetLifelineIcon(int number, LifelineType type, LifelineIconState state): Update individual icon
  - ClearLifelineIcons(): Remove all icons and reset state

- ✅ **ScreenUpdateService Enhancements**
  - Broadcast methods for lifeline icon control
  - ShowQuestion() calls ShowLifelineIcons() when showing
  - ShowWinningsAmount() NO LONGER calls HideLifelineIcons() (prevented crash)
  - ResetAllScreens() calls ClearLifelineIcons() for proper cleanup
  - Debug logging removed for performance

- ✅ **Resource Management**
  - Migrated 18 lifeline icons from VB.NET Resources to src/MillionaireGame/lib/textures
  - Icons embedded as resources via .csproj: `<EmbeddedResource Include="lib\textures\*.png" />`
  - Resources accessible via Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream()
  - **All icons present**: ll_5050, ll_ata, ll_ath, ll_double, ll_paf, ll_switch (3 states each)

#### Implementation Details
- **All Lifeline Types Update Icons**:
  * 50:50 (ExecuteFiftyFiftyAsync): Sets Used on line 135
  * PAF (ExecutePhoneFriendAsync): ActivateLifelineIcon line 183, Used in CompletePAF line 268
  * ATA (ExecuteAskAudienceAsync): ActivateLifelineIcon line 291, Used in CompleteATA line 391
  * STQ (ExecuteSwitchQuestionAsync): Sets Used immediately line 466
  * DD (ExecuteDoubleDipAsync): ActivateLifelineIcon when started, Used in CompleteDoubleDip line 597
  * ATH (ExecuteAskTheHostAsync): ActivateLifelineIcon line 503, Used in HandleAskTheHostAnswerAsync line 625

- **Debug Logging Cleanup**:
  - Removed excessive Console.WriteLine from rendering loops (HostScreenForm.DrawLifelineIcons)
  - Removed debug logging from LifelineIcons.LoadIcon()
  - Removed debug logging from ScreenUpdateService.ShowWinningsAmount()
  - Removed debug logging from ControlPanelForm.InitializeLifelineIcons()
  - System now runs clean without console flooding

#### Files Modified
- MillionaireGame.Core/Graphics/LifelineIcons.cs (NEW, 120 lines)
- MillionaireGame.Core/Game/GameService.cs (~204 lines - CRITICAL: dual collection sync)
- MillionaireGame/Forms/ControlPanelForm.cs (~3489 lines)
- MillionaireGame/Forms/HostScreenForm.cs (~900 lines)
- MillionaireGame/Forms/GuestScreenForm.cs (~833 lines)
- MillionaireGame/Forms/TVScreenFormScalable.cs (~966 lines)
- MillionaireGame/Services/ScreenUpdateService.cs (~408 lines)
- MillionaireGame/Services/LifelineManager.cs (~900 lines)
- 18 lifeline icon PNG files in lib/textures (6 types × 3 states)

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Rapid Click Protection**: Added guard checks in PAF and ATA timer ticks to prevent queued events
- **Standby Mode**: Multi-stage lifelines now set other buttons to orange, preventing multiple lifelines simultaneously
- **Click Cooldown**: 1-second delay between lifeline clicks prevents rapid clicking issues
- **Screen Visibility**: Icons remain visible on Host/Guest when question hidden, only TV screen hides icons
- **ATA Results Repositioning**: Moved to center below lifelines (635, 150) to avoid timer overlap
- **DD and ATH Activation**: Both now properly show yellow (Bling) icons when activated

#### Production Readiness
- ✅ All 6 lifeline types fully functional with complete icon lifecycle
- ✅ State persistence across questions working correctly
- ✅ Multi-stage protection prevents conflicts and UI pileups
- ✅ Screen-specific behavior properly implemented
- ✅ Debug logging cleaned up for production use
- ✅ Extensive testing completed with rapid clicks and edge cases

### Previous Session (Threading Fix - RevealAnswer Refactor) - December 22, 2025

#### Complete async/await Elimination in RevealAnswer
- ✅ **Threading Issue Resolution**
  - Fixed persistent cross-thread exceptions during answer reveal sequences
  - Root cause: `async void` with `await Task.Delay` causing continuations on ThreadPool threads
  - Solution: Complete removal of async/await, replaced with Windows Forms Timer-based delays
  - RevealAnswer changed from `async void` to `void` (synchronous method)
  - All UI operations now guaranteed to execute on UI thread (message pump)
  
- ✅ **Timer-Based Delay Implementation**
  - **initialDelayTimer**: 2-second delay before wrong answer sequence (lose sound)
  - **bedMusicTimer**: 2-second delay for Q1-5 bed music restart after correct answer
  - **winningsTimer**: 2-second delay before showing winnings after correct answer
  - **completionTimer**: 5-second delay for safety net animation completion
  - **q15Timer**: 25-second delay for Q15 victory sound sequence
  - All timers use `System.Windows.Forms.Timer` (fires on UI thread via message pump)
  - Proper disposal in Tick handlers prevents resource leaks
  
- ✅ **Code Organization Refactoring**
  - Created `ShowWinningsAndEnableButtons(int currentQuestionNumber)` helper method
  - Created `HandleQ15Win()` helper for Q15 victory sequence management
  - Refactored `ContinueWrongAnswerSequence(int droppedLevel)` to use timer
  - Created `FinishWrongAnswerSequence()` for final wrong answer UI updates
  - Cleaner separation of concerns and improved readability
  
- ✅ **Benefits**
  - Thread-safe by design: Windows Forms Timer always fires on UI thread
  - No thread context switching possible
  - No cross-thread exceptions can occur
  - No need for Invoke/BeginInvoke checks
  - Synchronous flow easier to understand and debug
  - Eliminates async void pitfalls entirely

- ✅ **Debug Logging Cleanup**

## Key Design Decisions

### Progressive Answer Reveal System
- State machine approach with `_answerRevealStep` (0-5)
- Question button acts as "Next" during reveal sequence
- Textboxes on control panel populate progressively to match screen behavior
- "Show Correct Answer to Host" only visible after all answers shown

### Game Outcome Tracking
- `GameOutcome` enum distinguishes Win/Drop/Wrong for proper winnings calculation
- Milestone checks use `>=` instead of `>` (Q5+ and Q10+)
- Thanks for Playing uses outcome to display correct final amount

### Cancellation Token Pattern
- Auto-reset after Thanks for Playing can be cancelled
- Closing button acts as "final task" - cancels all timers
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks

### Mutual Exclusivity Pattern
- Show Question and Show Winnings checkboxes cannot both be checked
- CheckedChanged event handlers enforce exclusivity
- Auto-show winnings respects exclusivity rules

### Screen Coordination
- `ScreenUpdateService` broadcasts to all screens via interfaces
- Event-driven updates prevent tight coupling
- Screens implement `IGameScreen` interface for consistency

### Money Tree Graphics Architecture (NEW)
- **TextureManager Singleton Pattern**
  - Centralized texture loading and caching
  - Embedded resource management from lib/textures/
  - ElementType enum for texture categories
  - GetMoneyTreePosition(int level) for level-specific overlays
  
- **VB.NET Coordinate Translation**
  - Original graphics had 650px blank space on left
  - User manually cropped images to 630×720 (removed blank space)
  - Code adjusted coordinates: money_pos_X (910→260), qno_pos_X (855→205/832→182)
  - Proportional scaling maintains aspect ratio (650px display height)
  
- **Three-State Button Pattern**
  - State 1: "Show Money Tree" (green) - Shows tree on TV
  - State 2: "Demo Money Tree" (blue) or "Hide Money Tree" (orange)
  - State 3: "Demo Running..." (yellow, disabled) during animation
  - _isExplainGameActive flag controls automatic state transitions
  
- **Demo Animation System**
  - Timer-based progression (System.Windows.Forms.Timer, 500ms interval)
  - Levels 1-15 displayed sequentially
  - UpdateMoneyTreeOnScreens(level) synchronizes all screens
  - Explain Game sets flag once, no audio restart
  
- **Winning Strap Conflict Resolution**
  - Show Money Tree automatically unchecks Show Winnings checkbox
  - Prevents visual overlap on TV screen
  - Clean user experience without manual checkbox management

## Notes for Future Developer (or Future Me)

### Code Style Conventions
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Prefer nullable reference types (enable warnings)
- Use event-driven patterns for UI updates
- Keep business logic in Core library
- XML documentation for public APIs

### Testing Strategies
- Manual testing with debug mode enabled (`--debug` flag)
- Console.WriteLine statements for debugging (wrapped in Program.DebugMode checks)
- Test with actual database and sound files
- Verify all screen states simultaneously

### Common Pitfalls
- Remember to reset `_answerRevealStep` for Q6+ Lights Down
- Milestone checks need `>=` not `>` (Q5 is level 4, Q10 is level 9)
- Audio file paths are relative to executable directory
- Closing button must cancel all active timers

### VB.NET → C# Translation Tips
- VB `Handles` → C# event subscription in constructor
- VB `Dim` → C# `var` or explicit type
- VB `Module` → C# `static class`
- VB `Optional` parameters → C# default parameters
- VB `ByRef` → C# `ref` or `out`
