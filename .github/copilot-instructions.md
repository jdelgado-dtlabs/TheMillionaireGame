- Always reuse the active terminal for commands.
- Do not create new terminal instances unless the current one is busy.
- Combine sequential commands (e.g., `cd path; dotnet build`) into one line.
- Always check if the application is already running before starting a build or run command.
- When switching between projects, change directories using `cd path` before executing project-specific commands.
- For .NET projects, use `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`, and `dotnet test`.
- For .NET projects, ensure to run in debug mode when testing new features.
- Avoid opening multiple terminals for the same project.
- Keep an eye on resource usage; close terminals that are no longer needed.
- Prioritize efficiency and context-awareness in terminal usage.
- Ensure commands are relevant to the current project and task.
- Focus on completing tasks in the current project before moving to another.
- Use clear and concise commands to minimize terminal clutter.
- Do not leverage terminal features like tabs or panes.
- Keep track of the current working directory to avoid confusion.
- Adapt terminal usage based on the complexity of the tasks at hand.
- Regularly clean up terminal sessions to remove outdated or irrelevant command history.
- Always verify the current directory before executing commands to prevent errors.
- When pausing work on a project, leave a detailed checkpoint file with the session state and next steps discussed during the session.
- When automating tasks, script terminal commands to maintain consistency and reduce manual errors.
- Continuously evaluate terminal usage patterns to identify areas for improvement in efficiency and context management.
- Never modify the original source project. That includes adding or changing files.
- When getting ready to end a session, create a summary file that outlines what was accomplished, any issues encountered, and next steps for future sessions.
- Always document any changes made to the workflow or terminal usage strategies for future reference.
- Always update the documentation to reflect the current state of the project after significant changes.
- Always check exisiting documentation before adding new information to avoid redundancy.
- When documenting, use clear and concise language to ensure understanding.
- Prioritize accuracy and completeness in documentation.
- Use version control for documentation to track changes over time.
- Regularly review, update and improve documentation to keep it relevant.
- When documenting code, include examples and use cases to illustrate functionality.
- Remove any outdated or irrelevant information from the documentation.
- When adding new features or changes, ensure you read and understand the original VB.NET implementation to maintain consistency.
- Verify what code is in the files to prevent adding duplicate code.
- Make sure that any warnings or errors are addressed before running a build or test command.
- If a build or test fails, analyze the output to identify and resolve issues before proceeding.
- If an implementation requires visual elements, ensure to run the application to verify correct rendering and behavior.
- Check you are in the correct project directory before executing commands to avoid cross-project errors.
- For this project, the build directory is `src/`.
- For this project, the main application directory is `src/MillionaireGame/`.
- For this project, the core library directory is `src/MillionaireGame.Core/`.
- When working on the core library, ensure to build and test the `MillionaireGame.Core` project.
- When working on the main application, ensure to build and run the `MillionaireGame` project.
- Don't use batch scripts or other automation tools unless specifically instructed.
- Always follow the project's coding standards and guidelines when making changes.
- Kill any rogue or stuck terminal processes that may interfere with current tasks.
- Kill the application process if it is running before a build or run command is issued.
- Use PowerShell commands where applicable for better compatibility with Windows environments. This includes using starter commands like `Start-Process` for launching applications.
- When running the application, ensure to use the appropriate command to launch the `.exe` file from the `bin/Debug/net8.0/` directory.
- Always ensure that the terminal environment is set up correctly for .NET development, including having the  .NET SDK installed and configured.
