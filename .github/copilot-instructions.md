- Always reuse the active terminal for commands.
- Do not create new terminal instances unless the current one is busy.
- Combine sequential commands (e.g., `cd path; dotnet build`) into one line.
- When switching between projects, change directories using `cd path` before executing project-specific commands.
- For .NET projects, use `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`, and `dotnet test` as needed.
- Prioritize efficiency and context-awareness in terminal usage.
- Ensure commands are relevant to the current project and task.
- Maintain a clean and organized terminal environment.
- Avoid unnecessary context switching between different project directories.
- Focus on completing tasks in the current project before moving to another.
- Use clear and concise commands to minimize terminal clutter.
- Leverage terminal features like tabs or panes only when absolutely necessary for multitasking.
- Keep track of the current working directory to avoid confusion.
- Adapt terminal usage based on the complexity of the tasks at hand.
- use terminal history to quickly access frequently used commands within the current project.
- When working on multiple related projects, ensure that terminal commands reflect the correct project context.
- Regularly clean up terminal sessions to remove outdated or irrelevant command history.
- Utilize terminal shortcuts to enhance productivity without losing focus on the current project.
- Document any complex terminal commands or sequences for future reference within the project context.
- Always verify the current directory before executing commands to prevent errors.
- When pausing work on a project, leave a note of the last executed commands for easy resumption.
- For collaborative projects, ensure terminal commands are standardized for team consistency.
- When automating tasks, script terminal commands to maintain consistency and reduce manual errors.
- Continuously evaluate terminal usage patterns to identify areas for improvement in efficiency and context management.
